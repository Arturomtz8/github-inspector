## Nostr

This project also works as a Nostr bot called [Golang Repositories](https://snort.social/p/npub1f2smj66w3gu2apw3sgapxjwfxgeknp6ae9g8spy7nq6ka9wp388quctf8n) that publishes trending Golang repositories on Github. Basically, it makes web scraping on the [Github Trending page](https://github.com/trending). Please, follow the bot for more content. The content is published once a day, at 11 am CST (16 pm UTC).
